**Guiding principles for technology at Mu**

## Foundation

Technology is a tool, not a destination. It should serve human flourishing, not exploit human weakness. These principles are rooted in timeless wisdom — particularly Islamic ethics (Shariah) — but speak to universal human values.

The core idea: **Technology should serve you, not exploit you.**

## The Five Principles

### 1. Intentionality (Niyyah)

Every action begins with intention. Technology should encourage intentional behavior, not mindless consumption.

**In practice:**
- Before you post, ask: *What is my intention here?*
- Before you send, ask: *Is this message kind, true, and necessary?*
- Before you consume, ask: *Will this benefit me?*

**How we build:**
- Features prompt reflection, not reaction
- No infinite scroll — there's always an end
- No notification bombardment — you come when you want

### 2. Moderation (Wasatiyyah)

Islam teaches the middle path — avoiding extremes. Technology use should be balanced, not obsessive.

**In practice:**
- AI summarizes to reduce screen time, not extend it
- 10 videos → 2 minute summary
- 50 articles → key points
- The goal is **less consumption**, not more

**How we build:**
- AI extracts value so you don't have to watch/read everything
- Clear boundaries on content
- Time-saving is the metric, not engagement

### 3. Truthfulness (Sidq)

Truth is sacred. Technology should not deceive, manipulate, or obscure reality.

**In practice:**
- No algorithmic manipulation
- No rage bait or engagement tricks
- No fake engagement metrics
- AI admits when it doesn't know

**How we build:**
- Chronological feeds, not algorithmic sorting
- No hidden agendas in content ranking
- Transparency in how features work

### 4. Kindness (Ihsan)

Excellence in character means being kind in all interactions. Technology should facilitate kindness, not cruelty.

**In practice:**
- Before sending a message, AI can hint: *Is this kind?*
- Before posting publicly, consider the impact
- Disagreement without insults

**How we build:**
- AI assistance that encourages thoughtful communication
- No anonymous pile-ons
- Features that humanize, not dehumanize

### 5. Trust (Amanah)

What is entrusted to you must be protected. Your data, your attention, your time — these are trusts.

**In practice:**
- Your data stays yours
- Your attention isn't sold to advertisers
- Your time isn't exploited for profit

**How we build:**
- Self-hostable — your server, your data
- No ads, no tracking
- No selling user information

## AI as a Tool

Where AI is used, it follows a simple rule: **assist, don't replace**.

- AI suggests, humans decide
- AI helps when useful, stays out of the way otherwise
- AI is honest — when uncertain, it says so
- AI serves you, not advertisers

## The Opposite of Addiction

Most technology is designed to maximize "engagement" — a euphemism for addiction. 

We design for the opposite:
- **Finite, not infinite** — Content ends
- **Intentional, not reactive** — You choose when to engage
- **Summarized, not sprawling** — Get the point, move on
- **Kind, not cruel** — Humanizing interactions
- **Honest, not manipulative** — No dark patterns

## Accountability

We build in public. The code is open source. If we fail to uphold these principles, you can:
1. See exactly how features work
2. Fork and fix
3. Hold us accountable

Technology should be trustworthy. That requires transparency.
