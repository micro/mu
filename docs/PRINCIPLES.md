# Principles

**Guiding principles for AI and technology at Mu**

## Foundation

Technology is a tool, not a destination. It should serve human flourishing, not exploit human weakness. These principles are rooted in timeless wisdom — particularly Islamic ethics (Shariah) — but speak to universal human values.

The core idea: **AI is a tool, not a replacement for God.**

## The Five Principles

### 1. Intentionality (Niyyah)

Every action begins with intention. Technology should encourage intentional behavior, not mindless consumption.

**In practice:**
- Before you post, ask: *What is my intention here?*
- Before you send, ask: *Is this message kind, true, and necessary?*
- Before you consume, ask: *Will this benefit me?*

**How we build:**
- Features prompt reflection, not reaction
- No infinite scroll — there's always an end
- No notification bombardment — you come when you want

### 2. Moderation (Wasatiyyah)

Islam teaches the middle path — avoiding extremes. Technology use should be balanced, not obsessive.

**In practice:**
- AI summarizes to reduce screen time, not extend it
- 10 videos → 2 minute summary
- 50 articles → key points
- The goal is **less consumption**, not more

**How we build:**
- AI extracts value so you don't have to watch/read everything
- Clear boundaries on content
- Time-saving is the metric, not engagement

### 3. Truthfulness (Sidq)

Truth is sacred. Technology should not deceive, manipulate, or obscure reality.

**In practice:**
- No algorithmic manipulation
- No rage bait or engagement tricks
- No fake engagement metrics
- AI admits when it doesn't know

**How we build:**
- Chronological feeds, not algorithmic sorting
- No hidden agendas in content ranking
- Transparency in how features work

### 4. Kindness (Ihsan)

Excellence in character means being kind in all interactions. Technology should facilitate kindness, not cruelty.

**In practice:**
- Before sending a message, AI can hint: *Is this kind?*
- Before posting publicly, consider the impact
- Disagreement without insults

**How we build:**
- AI assistance that encourages thoughtful communication
- No anonymous pile-ons
- Features that humanize, not dehumanize

### 5. Trust (Amanah)

What is entrusted to you must be protected. Your data, your attention, your time — these are trusts.

**In practice:**
- Your data stays yours
- Your attention isn't sold to advertisers
- Your time isn't exploited for profit

**How we build:**
- Self-hostable — your server, your data
- No ads, no tracking
- No selling user information

## AI as a Tool

AI in Mu follows a simple rule: **reduce, don't replace**.

| AI Should | AI Should Not |
|-----------|---------------|
| Summarize content to save time | Replace human judgment |
| Draft messages for you to refine | Send messages without review |
| Extract key points from videos | Decide what you should believe |
| Help you write clearly | Write without your input |
| Answer questions from your data | Replace deep study and reflection |

### AI Guardrails

1. **AI suggests, humans decide** — Final actions require human confirmation
2. **AI assists, not replaces** — For communication, drafts need human review
3. **AI accelerates, not addicts** — The goal is less screen time
4. **AI is honest** — When uncertain, it says so
5. **AI serves you** — Not advertisers, not engagement metrics

## Practical Applications

### For Video

Instead of watching 10 videos (5 hours), AI provides:
- Key points summary (2 minutes)
- Timestamps for important sections
- Questions you can ask about the content
- Decision: watch the whole thing, or move on with the summary

### For Mail

Instead of writing 50 emails from scratch:
- AI drafts based on context
- You refine and personalize
- AI hints if tone seems harsh
- Decision: send as-is, edit, or rewrite

### For Blog

Instead of reactive posting:
- AI prompts: *What's your intention with this post?*
- AI helps clarify your thinking
- No instant gratification of likes
- Focus on substance over performance

### For News

Instead of doomscrolling 100 articles:
- AI summarizes the day's important news
- Key points, not clickbait headlines
- You choose to go deeper or not
- Decision: informed in 5 minutes

## The Opposite of Addiction

Most technology is designed to maximize "engagement" — a euphemism for addiction. 

We design for the opposite:
- **Finite, not infinite** — Content ends
- **Intentional, not reactive** — You choose when to engage
- **Summarized, not sprawling** — Get the point, move on
- **Kind, not cruel** — Humanizing interactions
- **Honest, not manipulative** — No dark patterns

## Accountability

We build in public. The code is open source. If we fail to uphold these principles, you can:
1. See exactly how features work
2. Fork and fix
3. Hold us accountable

Technology should be trustworthy. That requires transparency.
