# About Mu

**A personal AI platform — without ads**

## What is Mu?

Mu is your private AI-powered home on the internet. While other platforms monetize your attention with ads (yes, even ChatGPT now), Mu helps you consume less, not more.

Think of Mu as the opposite of what the internet has become:

| The Internet Today | Mu |
|-------------------|-----|
| Infinite scroll | Finite, curated content |
| Algorithmic feeds | Chronological, you choose |
| Ad-supported AI | AI that works for you |
| Engagement metrics | Intentional creation |
| Screen time maximization | Screen time reduction |

## Why Mu Exists

The internet was supposed to connect us and make life better. Instead, American-owned corporations have optimized for addiction and extraction:

- **Rage bait** to keep you scrolling
- **Notifications** to pull you back
- **Likes and followers** to gamify your worth
- **Ads** disguised as content
- **AI assistants** that will soon serve advertisers

We built Mu to answer a simple question: **What would technology look like if it respected you?**

## Our Approach

### AI as a Tool, Not a Destination

AI in Mu exists to reduce your screen time, not increase it:

- **Summarize** instead of scroll — Read 50 articles in 2 minutes
- **Extract** instead of watch — Get key points from videos without watching
- **Draft** instead of compose — AI helps, you refine
- **Ask** instead of search — Get answers, not infinite results

The goal is 10x reduction in consumption. If you spent an hour on news before, it should take 6 minutes now.

### No Addiction Mechanics

We deliberately exclude features that drive addiction:

- **No likes** — Your worth isn't a number
- **No follower counts** — Quality over popularity
- **No infinite scroll** — There's always an end
- **No notifications** — You come when you want
- **No algorithmic ranking** — Chronological, transparent

### Privacy by Design

- **Your server, your data** — Self-host if you want
- **No tracking** — We don't profile you
- **No ads** — We don't sell your attention
- **End-to-end messaging** — Private by default
