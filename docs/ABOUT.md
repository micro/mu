**The Micro Network — apps without ads, algorithms, or tracking.**

## What is Mu?

Mu is a collection of micro apps for everyday use. While other platforms monetize your attention with infinite feeds and targeted ads, Mu gives you simple tools that respect your time.

Think of Mu as the opposite of what the internet has become:

| The Internet Today | Mu |
|-------------------|-----|
| Infinite scroll | Finite, curated content |
| Algorithmic feeds | Chronological, you choose |
| Ad-supported everything | No ads |
| Engagement metrics | Intentional use |
| Screen time maximization | Get in, get out |

## Why Mu Exists

The internet was supposed to connect us and make life better. Instead, platforms have optimized for addiction and extraction:

- **Rage bait** to keep you scrolling
- **Notifications** to pull you back
- **Likes and followers** to gamify your worth
- **Ads** disguised as content
- **Algorithms** that decide what you see

We built Mu to answer a simple question: **What would technology look like if it respected you?**

## Our Approach

### Simple Tools That Work

Each feature does one thing well:

- **Home** — Your dashboard, everything in one place
- **Apps** — Build and share micro apps
- **Blog** — Microblogging without the engagement tricks
- **Chat** — Group discussions
- **News** — RSS feeds, chronological
- **Video** — YouTube without ads or shorts
- **Notes** — Quick capture with tags and search
- **Mail** — Private messaging
- **Agent** — AI assistant when you need it

### No Addiction Mechanics

We deliberately exclude features that drive addiction:

- **No likes** — Your worth isn't a number
- **No follower counts** — Quality over popularity
- **No infinite scroll** — There's always an end
- **No push notifications** — You come when you want
- **No algorithmic ranking** — Chronological, transparent

### Privacy by Design

- **Your server, your data** — Self-host if you want
- **No tracking** — We don't profile you
- **No ads** — We don't sell your attention
- **Private messaging** — Between you and them

## AI Features

Some features are enhanced with AI:

- **News** — Summarize articles
- **Chat** — Knowledge assistant for discussions
- **Apps** — Generate apps from prompts
- **Agent** — AI assistant with tool access
- **Notes** — Auto-tagging and smart search

AI is a tool, not the product. It helps when useful, stays out of the way otherwise.
