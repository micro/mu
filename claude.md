# Mu Development Notes

## Deployment

- Production server: mu.xyz
- SSH: `ssh mu` (user: mu) or `ssh mu-root` (user: root) - both on port 61194
- Service: systemd `mu.service`
- Deploy: Push to main triggers GitHub Action that SSHes as `mu` user, pulls, builds, restarts

## Server Paths (as mu user)

- Source: `/home/mu/src/mu`
- Binary: `/home/mu/go/bin/mu`
- Env vars: `/home/mu/.env`
- Logs: `journalctl -u mu -f`

## SSH Config (on this VM)

```
Host mu          -> user mu (deploy key, limited sudo for systemctl)
Host mu-root     -> user root (full access, use sparingly)
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check status
ssh mu 'sudo systemctl status mu'

# View logs
ssh mu 'journalctl -u mu -f --no-pager -n 50'

# Check memory
ssh mu 'ps aux | grep "[/]home/mu/go/bin/mu"'

# Restart
ssh mu 'sudo systemctl restart mu'
```

## Recent Fixes

- Memory leak fix: Added 60s timeout and semaphore (max 5 concurrent) to LLM API calls
- Security: Moved from running as root to dedicated `mu` user with systemd
