# Membership

Mu is a membership network, whereby support, features and voting are available by paying a subscription fee. 

What are the benefits to this? Sustainability of the platform. Ad free, algorithm free, etc. Direct voice to 
the team building and running the network. This goes against the idea of a pricing plan or SaaS which is 
trying to sell you on something. Instead, yes you pay a monthly fee, but it's to be part of something.

Ideally its just a flat fee, nothing more.
